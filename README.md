# Cangjie Interoperability Subsystem

## Introduction

Cangjie provides developers with the capability to interoperate with Java and Objective-C languages. After successfully installing the Cangjie toolchain, you can use these capabilities according to the manual.

## Open Source Project Overview

The current interoperability features of Cangjie are:

- Cangjie-Java Interoperability
- Cangjie-Objective-C Interoperability

The corresponding software architecture diagrams are available at:

- [Cangjie-Java Interoperability Architecture](./java/doc/developer_guide.md#开源项目介绍)
- [Cangjie-ObjC Interoperability Architecture](./objc/doc/developer_guide.md#开源项目介绍)

The corresponding directory structures are:

- [Cangjie-Java Directory](./java/doc/developer_guide.md#目录)
- [Cangjie-ObjC Directory](./objc/doc/developer_guide.md#目录)
