+The GNU General Public License (GPL)
+
+Version 2, June 1991
+
+Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
+
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
+document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+Preamble
+
+The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
+and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
+guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
+software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
+most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
+authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
+covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
+General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
+distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
+that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
+the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
+can do these things.
+
+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
+you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
+translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
+software, or if you modify it.
+
+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
+a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
+make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
+show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
+offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
+and/or modify the software.
+
+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
+everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
+software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
+know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
+by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
+
+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
+wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
+individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
+To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
+everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
+follow.
+
+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
+placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
+this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
+or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
+derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
+Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
+translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
+without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
+"you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
+this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
+not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
+constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
+running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
+you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
+disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
+and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
+Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
+at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
+forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
+or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
+these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
+    that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
+    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
+    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
+    this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
+    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
+    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
+    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
+    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
+    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
+    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
+    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
+    not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
+sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
+considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
+its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
+works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
+work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
+of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
+whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
+rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
+right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
+the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
+Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
+distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
+License.
+
+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
+Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
+2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
+    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
+    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
+    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
+    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
+    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
+    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
+    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
+    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
+    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
+    Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
+modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
+the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
+definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
+of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
+distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
+source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
+of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
+code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
+third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
+expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
+sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
+your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
+rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
+long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
+However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
+or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
+accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
+any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
+do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
+the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
+copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
+You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
+rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
+third parties to this License.
+
+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
+are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
+contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
+conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
+obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
+For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
+of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
+you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
+the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
+other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
+section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
+distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
+people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
+distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
+distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
+choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
+consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
+countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
+copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
+geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
+distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
+such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
+of this License.
+
+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
+General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
+spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
+or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
+version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
+that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
+If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
+choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
+
+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
+whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
+permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
+write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
+Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
+all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
+software generally.
+
+NO WARRANTY
+
+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
+THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
+STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
+PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
+INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
+FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
+PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
+YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
+ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
+PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
+INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
+BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
+OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
+use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
+which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
+them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
+of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
+pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
+
+    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
+    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
+    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
+    any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
+    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
+    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
+    more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
+starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
+    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
+    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
+    type 'show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
+called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
+if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
+is a sample; alter the names:
+
+    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

+    Ty Coon, President of Vice
+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
+License instead of this License.
+
+
+"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
+
+Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
+subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
+only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
+the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
+exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
+
+    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
+    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
+    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
+
+    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
+    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
+    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
+    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
+    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
+    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
+    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
+    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
+    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
+    so, delete this exception statement from your version.
